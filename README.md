# WASM Contract Verification System

A deployment-time verification system that combines Proof-Carrying Code (PCC) and Proof-Carrying Data (PCD) to verify crucial safety properties of WASM contracts before deployment.

## üìö Core Concepts

### Proof-Carrying Code (PCC)
A formal verification technique where code includes mathematical proofs about its behavior. Used to verify:
- Specific safety properties (e.g., memory bounds)
- Resource usage constraints
- Compliance with protocol rules

### Proof-Carrying Data (PCD)
A technique for proving properties about computation steps. Used to verify:
- Each computation step is valid
- Results maintain required properties
- Proofs can be verified independently

Together, these provide strong guarantees about both code behavior and data flow.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Memory Safety Verification (PCC)
- Verify memory access patterns
- Check allocation bounds
- Ensure proper cleanup
- Prevent memory-related vulnerabilities

### Resource Usage Verification
- Track resource acquisition/release
- Verify cleanup on all paths
- Check resource bounds
- Prevent resource leaks

### State Verification
- Verify state transition rules
- Check computation steps
- Ensure invariants
- Maintain protocol safety

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### 1. Proof Generation
When you deploy a WASM contract, the system:
- Analyzes the contract code
- Generates safety proofs (PCC)
- Creates computation proofs (PCD)
- Builds verification circuits

### 2. Verification
The system verifies:
- Safety properties
- Resource constraints
- Computation correctness
- Protocol compliance

### 3. Results
You get one of two outcomes:

**‚úÖ Success**
- All proofs verify
- Properties hold
- Contract is safe
- Deployment proceeds

**‚ùå Failure**
- Shows verification failures
- Points to issues
- Explains problems
- Blocks deployment

### 4. Deployment
On success:
- Contract is deployed
- Verification complete
- Ready for execution

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Memory Safety Circuit
```rust
MemorySafetyCircuit:
- Tracks memory accesses (offset, size)
- Verifies allocation bounds
- Generates safety constraints
- Prevents memory corruption
```

### PCD Circuit
```rust
PCDCircuit:
- Verifies state transitions
- Maintains chain integrity
- Enables recursive composition
- Supports zero-knowledge proofs
```

## ‚ùì Why Beyond Rust's Compiler?

While Rust provides strong safety guarantees and testing helps catch bugs, some properties need mathematical proof:

### Rust Compiler Provides
- Memory safety through ownership
- Thread safety via borrowing
- Type safety
- Basic resource management

### Testing Provides
- Functional verification
- Edge case coverage
- Integration checks
- Runtime behavior

### Our System Adds
- Mathematical proofs of properties
- Verification of all code paths
- Guaranteed bounds on resources
- Proof of invariant preservation

The key difference is **proof vs testing**:
- Testing shows bugs exist
- Our system proves bugs can't exist
- Testing covers some paths
- Our system verifies all paths

This makes it particularly valuable for critical systems where testing alone isn't enough.



## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Properties Verified

While Rust's compiler provides excellent memory safety guarantees, additional properties need verification. Our system verifies:

### Memory Properties
- **Access Safety**: Verify all accesses are valid
- **Allocation Safety**: Ensure proper memory management
- **Cleanup Safety**: Verify proper resource cleanup
- **Bounds Safety**: Prevent out-of-bounds operations

### Resource Properties
- **Resource Tracking**: Track acquisition and release
- **Usage Patterns**: Verify proper usage patterns
- **Cleanup Verification**: Ensure cleanup on all paths
- **Bound Checking**: Prevent resource exhaustion

### State Properties
- **State Transitions**: Verify valid state changes
- **Invariants**: Maintain system invariants
- **Computation Steps**: Verify computation validity
- **Safety Rules**: Enforce safety properties

### Protocol Properties
- **Protocol Rules**: Verify compliance with rules
- **Safety Properties**: Enforce safety constraints
- **Computation Validity**: Verify correct behavior
- **Invariant Preservation**: Maintain system invariants

The system complements Rust's compile-time checks by proving these properties at deployment time.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

### Resource Safety Verification
```rust
ResourceSafetyCircuit:
- Track resource lifecycle
- Verify cleanup paths

```

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Resource tracking system
2. Safety property verification
3. Lifecycle verification
4. Property preservation

### Integration Benefits
