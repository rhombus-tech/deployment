# WASM Contract Verification System

A deployment-time verification system that combines Proof-Carrying Code (PCC) and Proof-Carrying Data (PCD) to verify crucial safety properties of WASM contracts before deployment.

## üí° Why Rust + Verification?

Our system provides strong safety guarantees while letting you use the full power of Rust:

### Safety Without Sacrifice
- Type safety verification
- Resource usage control
- Linear type guarantees
All without leaving the Rust ecosystem.

### Benefits Over Restricted Languages
- Use any Rust library
- Mature tooling and ecosystem
- Larger developer pool
- More expressive power
- Custom property verification

No need to learn a new language or accept limitations - get safety guarantees while keeping Rust's flexibility.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Properties Verified

While Rust's compiler provides excellent safety guarantees, our system adds Move-like verification at deployment time:

### Type Safety Properties
- **Linear Types**: Verify resources can't be copied or discarded
- **Type Constraints**: Ensure type rules are followed
- **Resource Types**: Verify proper resource handling
- **Type State**: Track type state transitions

### Resource Properties
- **Resource Tracking**: Verify resources are never duplicated or lost
- **Usage Patterns**: Ensure resources are properly consumed
- **Lifecycle Management**: Track resource creation to destruction
- **Access Control**: Verify proper resource ownership

### State Properties
- **State Transitions**: Verify valid state changes
- **Invariants**: Maintain system invariants
- **Computation Steps**: Verify computation validity
- **Safety Rules**: Enforce safety properties

### Protocol Properties
- **Protocol Rules**: Verify compliance with rules
- **Safety Properties**: Enforce safety constraints
- **Computation Validity**: Verify correct behavior
- **Invariant Preservation**: Maintain system invariants

The system provides Move-like guarantees while allowing full use of Rust's ecosystem and expressiveness.

## üìö Core Technology

### Proof-Carrying Code (PCC)
A formal verification technique where code includes mathematical proofs about its behavior[^1]. Used to verify:
- Specific safety properties (e.g., memory bounds)
- Resource usage constraints
- Compliance with protocol rules

### Proof-Carrying Data (PCD)
A technique for proving properties about computation steps[^1]. Used to verify:
- Each computation step is valid
- Results maintain required properties
- Proofs can be verified independently

Together, these provide strong guarantees about both code behavior and data flow.

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### 1. Proof Generation
When you deploy a WASM contract, the system:
- Analyzes the contract code
- Generates safety proofs (PCC)
- Creates computation proofs (PCD)
- Builds verification circuits

### 2. Verification
The system verifies:
- Safety properties
- Resource constraints
- Computation correctness
- Protocol compliance

### 3. Results
You get one of two outcomes:

**‚úÖ Success**
- All proofs verify
- Properties hold
- Contract is safe
- Deployment proceeds

**‚ùå Failure**
- Shows verification failures
- Points to issues
- Explains problems
- Blocks deployment

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

1. **Run All Tests**
```bash
cd verify
cargo test --all
```

2. **Run Specific Test Suites**
```bash
# Memory safety tests
cargo test --package verify --lib "circuits::memory_safety::tests"

# Control flow tests
cargo test --package verify --lib "circuits::control_flow::tests"

# Type safety tests
cargo test --package verify --lib "circuits::type_safety::tests"

# Resource bounds tests
cargo test --package verify --lib "circuits::resource_bounds::tests"
```

3. **Run Tests with Logging**
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:

1. **Unit Tests**
- Memory access validation
- Control flow verification
- Type safety checks
- Resource bounds monitoring

2. **Integration Tests**
- Full WebAssembly modules
- Complex interaction patterns
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Performance benchmarks

3. **Vulnerability Tests**
- Buffer overflow attempts
- Reentrancy attacks
- Type confusion scenarios
- Resource exhaustion cases

### Adding New Tests

1. Create a test module:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_your_feature() {
        // Your test code here
    }
}
```

2. Run the test:
```bash
cargo test test_your_feature
```

### Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline automatically runs:
- All test suites
- Linting checks
- Format verification
- Documentation tests
