## Findings

### Issue #1

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #2

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #3

Potential reentrancy vulnerability detected: state changes after external call to 0xd32c87e169f58eadbe78210dd74d95e1fe0426456976e43a082e0828424c77ae

### Issue #4

Potential read-only reentrancy vulnerability detected: view function relies on storage that could be manipulated during reentrancy

### Issue #5

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #6

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #7

### Issue #8

Potential read-only reentrancy vulnerability detected: view function relies on storage that could be manipulated during reentrancy

### Issue #9

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #10

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #11

Potential reentrancy vulnerability detected: state changes after external call to 0x9f4445f16429a1b59d9205bdc829435cef67ebe81af9e9bbaec50beaffaa2fb2

### Issue #12

Potential read-only reentrancy vulnerability detected: view function relies on storage that could be manipulated during reentrancy

## Delegate Calls

| PC | Target | Depth |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 0 | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | 0 |
| 0 | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | 1 |

## Recommendations

1. Review all potential reentrancy vulnerabilities and ensure proper guards are in place
2. Implement checks for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow/underflow
3. Carefully audit delegate calls to ensure they cannot be exploited
4. Follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern for all external calls
5. Consider using OpenZeppelin's security contracts for standardized protections
