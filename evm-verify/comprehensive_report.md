## Severity Breakdown

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 3 |
| Medium | 0 |
| Low | 0 |
| Informational | 0 |

## Findings

### Issue #1

Potential read-only reentrancy vulnerability detected: view function relies on storage that could be manipulated during reentrancy

### Issue #2

Potential read-only reentrancy vulnerability detected: view function relies on storage that could be manipulated during reentrancy

### Issue #3

Potential read-only reentrancy vulnerability detected: view function relies on storage that could be manipulated during reentrancy

## Delegate Calls

| PC | Target | Depth |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 0 | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | 0 |
| 0 | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | 1 |

## Recommendations

1. Review all potential reentrancy vulnerabilities and ensure proper guards are in place
2. Implement checks for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow/underflow
3. Carefully audit delegate calls to ensure they cannot be exploited
4. Follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern for all external calls
5. Consider using OpenZeppelin's security contracts for standardized protections
