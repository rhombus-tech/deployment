## Findings

### Issue #1

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #2

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #3

Potential reentrancy vulnerability detected: state changes after external call to 0xcfb11f1a8a9447bb8a715f6a5981c10dd4d7a459e031b2b58bf69057e7ec268b

### Issue #4

Potential read-only reentrancy vulnerability detected: view function relies on storage that could be manipulated during reentrancy

### Issue #5

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #6

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #7

Potential reentrancy vulnerability detected: state changes after external call to 0xb7e83c587ea1a826edc1b08e89dfe212cf9a78aed5241e590418afa9082ce1ef

### Issue #8

Potential read-only reentrancy vulnerability detected: view function relies on storage that could be manipulated during reentrancy

### Issue #9

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #10

Potential cross-function reentrancy vulnerability detected: external call could reenter through a different function that modifies the same state

### Issue #11

Potential reentrancy vulnerability detected: state changes after external call to 0x594a53a363cc85d6c5b50a7ed4561470e15cb123cf136fb838b0f21183cc4bfc

### Issue #12

## Delegate Calls

| PC | Target | Depth |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 0 | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | 0 |
| 0 | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | 1 |

## Recommendations

1. Review all potential reentrancy vulnerabilities and ensure proper guards are in place
2. Implement checks for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow/underflow
3. Carefully audit delegate calls to ensure they cannot be exploited
4. Follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern for all external calls
5. Consider using OpenZeppelin's security contracts for standardized protections
